first thought about this question 
is the join the string into one word then use slider to reverse.
this process is just O(n)
before this, have to also get the index of space, then append this later, will be O(n)

        #turn words into array 
        words = s.split()
        #reverse the array order
        words = words[::-1]
        # join them back together with " "
        result = " ".join(words)
        return result


can simplify this into one line (pretty insane)
return " ".join(s.split()[::-1])

BRO I DID THIS WITHOUT THINKING, JUST COME STRIGHT TO MY HEAD, LETS GOOOOOOO ONE SHOT 100%!!!!!!
FINISHED THIS QUESTION USING 10 SECONDS!!!!!!! eziest medium question ever.

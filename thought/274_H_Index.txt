The question asks for
h-index = 1 means at least 1 element has 1 or more values
h-index = 2 means at least 2 elements have 2 or more values
h-index = 3 means at least 3 elements have 3 or more values.

So sort, reverse order, and start searching for index>value.
If not, it's not valid.

The left pointer of a binary search is the last valid element.

use sliding windows, but can be simplify to only one pointer, 
use k to calcualte the other pointer --> window size

#check exsit
use map to store num:digit --> use digit calculate window size

#looping
keep moving i to next one --> check if num【i ] in the set
#check size
calculate window size by current ( digit -  digit last time seen) <= k
if not seen just make the value = digit

Check three things to determine if a Sudoku board is valid:

Each row must not contain duplicate digits

Each column must not contain duplicate digits

Each 3x3 box must not contain duplicate digits

First loop:
For each row i, use a seen set to track digits — if a digit appears twice, return False.

Second loop:
For each column j, use a new seen set — same idea.

Third loop:
For every 3x3 box (looping through starting indices 0, 3, 6), check all 9 cells using a seen set.

If no duplicates are found in any of these checks, return True.

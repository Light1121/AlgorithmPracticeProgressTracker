This question's keywords are **last word** so I might have to loop reversely or just reverse the word.
and deal with " " at the same time.

a easy method will be just loop from the back, doing a IF it is " " skip, 
and untill found string that is NOT " ", the start counting, untill it meets " " again

also always use for loop to stop at the first index, 
so dont have to do another if statement to check if is the first word (for example test case "a" )

my method is to just get the index of the word ending
and get the word index of word starting  then subtrack
        end_of_word = len(s) - 1

        while s[end_of_word] == " ":
            end_of_word -= 1

        start = 0
        for i in range(end_of_word, -1, -1):
            if s[i] == " ":
                start = i + 1
                break
            
        return end_of_word + 1 - start

use Magazine(M) to build RansomNote (R)
each letter in M can only use once.

make a map, loop the (M) store number of time letter exsist 
key : value --> letter: number of time occure

then loop (R) if letter not found in map meaning false
if exsist then subtract on continue
when there is number hits 0 meaning not enough letter to build R
return false

if all loop successfully --> True

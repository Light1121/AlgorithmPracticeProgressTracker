pretty ez, just loop t only once
meanwhile, search for each digit in s
if some index is not yet found, remain the same index untill found
since only looping the t
if reached the end then meaning not found return false
code:
        if len(s) == 0:
            return True
        
        current_index = 0
        for char in t:
            if char == s[current_index]:
                current_index += 1
            if current_index == len(s):
                return True
   
        return False

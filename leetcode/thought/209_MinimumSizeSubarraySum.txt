DID IT WRONG BECASUE YOU READ THE QUESTION WRONG!!

IS SUBSTRING, meaning have to be continuse 
for example: Target =100, {2,1,1,1,1,1,1,98}, the shorstest is 2. but not valid since it skips

so only way to solve is sliding windows, so cannot sort as well.
        min_len = float("inf")
        left = 0
        cur_sum = 0

        for right in range(len(nums)):
            cur_sum += nums[right]

            while cur_sum >= target:
                if right - left + 1 < min_len:
                    min_len = right - left + 1
                cur_sum -= nums[left]
                left += 1
        
        return min_len if min_len != float("inf") else 0

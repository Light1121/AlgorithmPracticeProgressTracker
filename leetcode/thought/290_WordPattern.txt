split the sentence into array
now
use a map to pair the letter
as stated in example
Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.
but have to make 2 map make sure it is unique
example --> s = "ab", t = "aa"

just check if exsit or not if not then insert
if exsist then check if matching
FOR BOTH MAP
untill loop all element done
